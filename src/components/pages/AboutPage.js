            Hello. <br /> my names Chris.
          </AboutHeader>
          <br />
          <p>
            Over the past 6 years Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working as a store
            manager across 2 businesses gaining experience in many different
            collaborative environments and situations. 5 months ago, I stepped
            down from my position to chase a new passion with the hope of
            finding a new career path. I believe the key to success is really
            giving it your all in every opportunity you have through every
            single task, every single day, through hard work anything can be
            achieved.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since stepping down I've been working towards a new career path of
            becoming a web developer and for the past 5 months I've been a
            fast-track student at Coder Academy Melbourne where I'm honing my
            skills and knowelege so in a few months I will be ready to join the
            workforce as a junior developer.
            <br />
            <br />
            Through my expierences of life, work and study I've found my passion
            for technology, problem solving, collaboration and teamwork. I'm
            hoping through this new career path I can continue to persue these
            passions and work towards a career that can be more impactful.
