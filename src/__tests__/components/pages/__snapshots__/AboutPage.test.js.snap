      Hello. 
      <br />
       my names Chris.

    <br />
    <p>
      Over the past 6 years Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working as a store manager across 2 businesses gaining experience in many different collaborative environments and situations. 5 months ago, I stepped down from my position to chase a new passion with the hope of finding a new career path. I believe the key to success is really giving it your all in every opportunity you have through every single task, every single day, through hard work anything can be achieved.
      <br />
      <br />
      Since stepping down I've been working towards a new career path of becoming a web developer and for the past 5 months I've been a fast-track student at Coder Academy Melbourne where I'm honing my skills and knowelege so in a few months I will be ready to join the workforce as a junior developer.
      <br />
      <br />
      Through my expierences of life, work and study I've found my passion for technology, problem solving, collaboration and teamwork. I'm hoping through this new career path I can continue to persue these passions and work towards a career that can be more impactful.
