    <p>
      I’m a highly motivated and passionate individual looking for my next opportunity. Over the past 6 years I’ve had the privilege of leading, and working within a wide array of teams across multiple businesses gaining experience in many collaborative environments and situations.
      <br />
      <br />
      I am now refocusing my career goals to combine what I learnt from and loved about my previous positions with my passion for technology.
      <br />
      <br />
      3 months ago I completed my Diploma of Information of Technology with Coder Academy Melbourne, A fully accredited 6-month full time, full stack web development course focused on fast paced learning via projects. During my time at Coder Academy I learned many different web technologies beginning with my first project which was a Ruby terminal app that explored object orientated design patterns, followed by a Ruby on Rails marketplace that introduced me to the MVC architecture, before finishing the course with a group project based on the MERN stack for a real world client. This final project would be a combination of everything we had learnt so far as well as the first time we would collaborate with other developers on a single project – for me, this was by far the most challenging and rewarding of all the assessments at Coder Academy. 
      <br />
      My experience at Coder Academy wasn’t just about learning programming languages, it was about preparing for the industry. We also touched on cloud development tools, problem solving, user experience design and accessibility, discrete maths, version control and how to work in a professional development team using an Agile workflow.
      <br />
      <br />
      Since then I’ve been focused on continuing my own development and learning improve every single day while I look for new opportunities to follow in my developer journey.
      <br />
      <br />
      I can’t wait to begin my new career and I’d love to hear from you.
